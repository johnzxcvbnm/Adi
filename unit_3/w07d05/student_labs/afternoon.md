# Lab - AJAX and Angular

- The page should have a form that uses the [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.
 - **NOTE** the `s=` search doens't have as much data as the `t=` search. It should still have a title, year and poster, but the other fields will remain emtpy. Feel free to update your html to only show the data that matches the `s=` search

- When the user clicks on a search result display detailed information about that movie.
  - *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every Star Wars movie and clicks on `Star Wars: A New Hope`, detailed information about that specific movie will be displayed.
