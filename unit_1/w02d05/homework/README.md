# Space Battle and eCardly
## There are two parts to this weekend hw
1. Space Battle
2. eCardly

> :red_circle: **BOTH** are required!

## Space Battle

Minimum Functionality Required for this homework to be considered complete:
1. A game that loads by opening an html file in the browser, the game works through the Chrome console, with alerts, console.log messages and prompts
    - Bonus: use DOM manipulation **instead** of alerts and prompts
1. A working game that loads without any syntax errors on start
1. You have a battleship that can attack an alien ship at least one time 
    - Be sure to display this info somewhere - in the console or in an alert is fine
    - Remember, all ships should have: hitpoints(hull), damage points(firepower)
1. You have _at least_ one alien ship that has hitpoints and damage points that can attack your ship at least one time  
    - Again, be sure to display this info somewhere - in the console or in an alert is fine
1. The two ships battle until one is destroyed (i.e. has a hull <= 0) and a win/lose message is displayed
1. Refer to the original [markdown](https://gist.github.com/jlboba/de36cb714377b26be5e4e45235ec57b4) for more details

## eCardly

## Objectives
* More reps building webpage from an image

## Activity
* Inside the [starter folder provided](eCardly), you'll find the [mockup image](eCardly/screenshot-final.png) that you should recreate 
* Inside that starter folder as well is [another folder](eCardly/images) with all the images you'll need for the recreation 
* Below are a few steps to help you get started

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6. 
    - Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line.

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

### Header Picture

* The `<h1>` tag with the `<a>` tag inside of it should not be text but an image.

* Please remove the text from the html.

* Set the background of the `<a>` tag within an `<h1>` to the logo.png.

* Size it's height and width appropriately to fit the full logo.

* Have it display block.  This will have this tag appear on it's on line.  (It is how we can make it appear here).
