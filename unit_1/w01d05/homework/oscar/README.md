Layout [Oscar's website](https://www.hioscar.com/).

Your job is to use Oscar's website as a mockup and try to recreate it with HTML and CSS.

    - You might notice that the site changes layout depending on the width of the browser.  Ignore this for now.  Just mimic how the site looks when it fills your monitor's width
    - The images are in the [images/](images) directory, except for the header. For that, just use a solid color background or use whatever image you like.
    - Don't worry about icons like facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram.  As a stretch, use the inspector to see what they did and try to copy it.
    - Don't worry about all the little animations and changes that the site does when you roll over certain aspects of it
    - The header stays in place as you scroll down.  For now don't worry about mimicking that.  If you want, see if you can get that to work
    - Don't worry about matching the fonts the site uses.  Just use `font-family: Arial` or `font-family: Times New Roman` or whatever you like.
    - Don't worry about rounded corners of buttons.  If you can figure it out, great!
    - It's fine to guess at the colors
    - The main thing we want you to focus on is the positioning/layout.
