1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

<details><summary>Hungry for more?</summary>

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price

## Practice with Loops - Nested Loop
You may need to do a little bit of research on nested for loops, but try to solve this on your own first:

1. Print out each individual number in this grid:

```javascript
const grid = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```
