## Fake Resume Site
![Grumpy Cat](https://i.imgur.com/n8lbaJB.png)

Grumpy cat is looking for a new job! Using what you know about HTML and CSS from watching the videos above, help him by creating a resume website for him.

Note sure if you need to watch the videos? Check yourself: Your resume should include the following from the videos:
- an `index.html` file
- an `main.css` file that is linked to the `index.html` file
- HTML `boilerplate` code for `index.html` HINT: in your `index.html` file type `html` and press tab. A few basic HTML tags should populate your file, including `head` and `body`
- Include
  - at least one header
  - navigation (these can be dummy links that don't go anywhere yet)
  - at least one list
  - change the font color in at least one place
  - change the background in at least one place
  - change the font in at least one place
  - Try adding a grid using flex-box - this could be a grid of images, boxes of text, or whatever your imagination comes up with!


(Note: You don't need to know real information about Grumpy Cat, just make things up.)


### Setup

1. Inside your `w01d03/homework` folder, create a new folder called `resume_page`.
1. Change directories to `resume_page`.
1. From inside this file, create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.<br>
1. Using Atom, open your files and add the HTML boilerplate code.<br>
1. Create a heading level-one tag with the name: Grumpy Cat.<br>
1. Open the `index.html` in your browser to confirm that everything is set up properly.
Reminder: To open your file with your browser, from the command line, type `open index.html`

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"index.html file is setup".
<hr>

#### Add some content to your site

1. Insert a professional image of him/her ('img' tag); it should be placed right after your 'h1' tags<br>
1. Insert an unordered list of three work positions ('ul' tag)<br>
1. Create links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag). You can set this to a dummy link `#` or find yours / thiers and attach that<br>
1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before your positions and before your links<br>
