# Afternoon lab 

## Setup
1. Create a file called `loops_and_boolean_practice.js` in your `student_examples` folder for today.
2. Open your file in your text editor using your terminal commands.
3. Run your code in terminal by running `node loops_and_boolean_practice.js` to see anything that you log from your file as output in your terminal.

## Practice using Spectacle
Adjust your windows *using Spectacle hot keys* to have your view look like this:

Notice that they're not split evenly (my text editor is taking up 2/3 of the screen).

## Loops & Booleans

### Loop it!
1. Create a loop that will print "hi" 15 times.
1. Create a loop that will print "YEP!" 30 times.

### Booleans & Loops - Part 1
1. Create a variable called `some_num` and assign a random number.
1. Create a loop that will print "that's a small number" if `some_num` is less than 10. 
1. Create another loop that will print "that's a big number" if the value of `sum_num` is greater than 20.
1. Take these two loops and adjust them so that they can be used together. Write some code to deal with what happens if `some_num` is a value in between between 10 - 20.

## Intro to Pseudo-coding
You'll be learning more about [pseudo-coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) later in the week, but as a quick introduction:
Pseudo-coding is writing out what you think the question is asking or structuring your answer in **human language** rather than *computer language*. Before you create a variable or write out a loop, write down what you're thinking (like you're explaining it to another person) before you solve the problem.

Try to pseudo-code the next section **before** you write any computer code.

### Booleans & Loops - Part 2
1. Create a variable called `fave_day` and assign it to your favorite day of the week.
1. Create a loop that uses the variable `fave_day` that you created. Make a loop that will print `I like the weekend` if `fave_day` equals Saturday or Sunday. The loop should print `Give me a good 'ol weekday` if `fave_day` is equal to Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
1. Think about outliers: What if I had entered "September" in `fave_day`? What would happen? Add something to your code to handle that situation.

# Hungry for More?
Try out some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems. Specifically try out numbers 1 & 2.
