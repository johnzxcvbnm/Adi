# Array and Object Methods


## Intro

The best way to find out if you really understand something, is to explain/teach it to someone else. 

Additionally, during technical interviews you will be asked to define and or describe things. It's great practice to learn to talk about code now

## Set up

You'll be put into groups. Each group will get a different Object or Array method to research, answer questions about and demo. This 'teachback' should take ~2 minutes per group (keep it short and sweet)



### For Each 
 - Describe this method 
 - Compare/Contrast to `.map()`
 - When would you use them?
 - Is there a specific datatype to use with these loops (Array, Object, etc.)
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of these loops and demo/explain to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel
 
### Map
 - Describe this method
 - Compare/Contrast to `.forEach()`
 - When would you use them?
 - Is there a specific datatype to use with these loops (Array, Object, etc.)
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of these loops and demo/explain to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel

 ### For In
 - Describe this loop
 - When would you use it?
 - Is there a specific datatype to use with these loops (Array, Object, etc.)
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of this loops and demo/explain to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel
 
 ### For Of
 - Describe this loop
 - When would you use it?
 - Is there a specific datatype to use with these loops (Array, Object, etc.)
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of this loops and demo/explain to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel
 
### For Loop Break Statement
- Describe what `break` and `continue` are/how they work inside a for loop
- When would you use them?
- Find (or write) a very simple demo of how to use them and explain it to the class (post your code in tech talk)
- Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel

### For Loop Continue Statement
- Describe what `break` and `continue` are/how they work inside a for loop
- When would you use them?
- Find (or write) a very simple demo of how to use them and explain it to the class (post your code in tech talk)
- Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel


### While / Do While
 - Describe these loops (compare/contrast)
 - When would you use them?
 - Is there a specific datatype to use with these loops (Array, Object, etc.)
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of these loops and demo/explain to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel

### Object.keys
 - Describe how this method could be used (in conjunction with another loop) to loop over an object's key and value pairs
 - When would you use it?
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of how to use this method and explain it to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel

### Object.values
 - Describe how this method could be used (in conjunction with another loop) to loop over an object's key and value pairs
 - When would you use it?
 - Find (or write) a very simple demo of how to use this method and explain it to the class (post your code in tech talk)
 - Provide the best link you found in the tech talk slack channel
