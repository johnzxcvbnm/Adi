During last morning exercise we built out the html for our blog that had this mockup:


# Activity

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://i.imgur.com/XLnBkER.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
1) You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise. You should have created it in your `w01d04/morning_exercise` folder. We called it `index.html`.

2. Let's copy your work into your `student_examples` folder for today.

- In terminal:
 - navigate to your `/w02d01/student_examples` folder
 - create a new folder called `morning_mockup`
 - navigate inside `morning_mockup`
 - from there type `cp ../../../w02d01/morning_exercise/mockup_practice/*.html .` NOTE: if you created more files than this (like a CSS file), you will also need to copy those files.
 - This command will copy all `html` files from yesterday's folder into today's `student_exercise` folder

 Note: if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path.

 Note: if you struggled making the html, we've included an `sample_index.html` for you to work off of in this folder.

## Stretch:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Fix the margins, font, layout, etc. to make this site look more professional!
