## Communication Tools

### Slack
#### 4 channels
	- adi-classroom - headers, notes, announcements
	- adi-partytime - tangents, off topics, socializing, giphys
  - adi-tech-talk - TA hours/TA help
	- adi-outcomes - All things outcomes

#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the outrun channels:
	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/ta's use this)

##### Communicate privately:
- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see.
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately.

##### Other:
	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages
### Zoom
