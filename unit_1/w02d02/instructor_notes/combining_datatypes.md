# Combining data types

## Lesson Objectives

1. Combine objects, arrays, and functions
1. Combine objects, arrays, and functions more than one level deep

## Combine objects, arrays, and functions

You can create a property for an object that is an array

```javascript
const foo = {
    someArray:[1,2,3]
};
foo.someArray[0]; //1
```
You can create a property for an object that is an object

```javascript
const foo = {
    someObject: {
        someProperty: 'oh hai!'
    }
};
foo.someObject.someProperty; //oh hai!
```

You can create a property for an object that is a function (method)

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        console.log('oh hai');
    }
};

foo.someMethod();//logs 'oh hai!'
```

You can store an object in an array

```javascript
const foo = [{someProperty:'weee'}, 2, 3];

console.log(foo[0].someProperty);
```

You can store an array in an array

```javascript
const foo = [
    ["0,0", "0,1", "0,2"],
    ["1,0", "1,1", "1,2"],
    ["2,0", "2,1", "2,2"]
];

foo[1][2]; //1,2
```

You can store a function in an array

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    "hi",
    ()=>{
        console.log('fun');
    }
];

foo[2]();
```

You can loop over an array in an object

```javascript
const foo = {
    someArray:[1,2,3]
};

for(element of foo.someArray){
    console.log(element);
}
```

You can loop over an array in an array.  Just add an additional [*index*] after the first [*index*]

```javascript
const foo = [
    ["0,0", "0,1", "0,2"],
    ["1,0", "1,1", "1,2"],
    ["2,0", "2,1", "2,2"]
];

for(row of foo){
    for(element of row){
        console.log(element);
    }
}
```

## Activity
1. Create an object called "bootcamp" with an array called "skills", and a function called "feeling".
1. In the array add no less than 5 skills you have learned so far in the class.
1. The function should log how you are feeling about the Bootcamp today from one of these responses ("Im okay, hanging in there!", "ALERT! Panic Zone", "Feeling good, feeling challenged");
1. Loop over the items in the array
1. Call the function in the array. 


## Combine objects, arrays, and functions more than one level deep

You can create a function that returns an object.  Just add the `.` after the `()` since the return value of the function is an object

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return {
        someProperty: 'hi!'
    }
};

foo().someProperty;//hi
```

You can create a function that returns an array.  Just add `[index]` after the `()` since the return value of the function is an array

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return ['apple','banana','pear'];
};

foo()[1]; //banana
```

You can create a function that returns an object that has an array

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return {
        someArray: ['fun', 'awesome', 'sweet']
    }
};

foo().someArray[1]; //awesome
```

You can create a function that returns an object that has an object

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return {
        someObject: {
            someProperty: 'some value'
        }
    }
};

foo().someObject.someProperty; //some value
```

You can create a function that returns an object that has a method

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return {
        someMethod:()=>{
            console.log('oh hai!');
        }
    }
};

foo().someMethod(); //logs 'oh hai!'
```

You can create a function that returns a function.  Just add the `()` after the first `()` since the return value of the first function is another function

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
    return ()=>{
        console.log('whaaaa?');
    }
};

foo()(); //logs 'whaaaa?'
```

## Activity - Returning Functions
1. Create a function that returns an object called "Weekend" that returns one thing you are excited for this weeked. Log the return value of the function.
1. Create a function that returns an object called "favBand" that has a method which returns your favorite song from that band. Log the result of the method!
1. Create a function called "favFood" that returns a function that logs your favorite food. Log the result!

You can create an object that has a method that returns an object

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        return {
            someProperty: 'some value'
        }
    }
};

foo.someMethod().someProperty;
```

You can create an object that has a method that returns an object that has an array

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        return {
            someArray: ['peach', 'apple', 'pear']
        }
    }
}

foo.someMethod().someArray[2]; //pear
```

You can create an object that has a method that returns an object that has an object

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        return {
            someObject: {
                someProperty: 'some value'
            }
        }
    }
}

foo.someMethod().someObject.someProperty; //some value
```

You can create an object that has a method that returns an object that has another method

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        return {
            someMethod:()=>{
                console.log('both methods can have the same name!');
            }
        }
    }
}

foo.someMethod().someMethod(); //logs 'both methods can have the same name!'
```

You can create an object that has a method that returns a function

```javascript
const foo = {
    someMethod:()=>{
        return ()=>{
            console.log('hi')
        }
    }
}
foo.someMethod()();//logs hi
```

You can create an array that has a function that returns an object

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    'apple',
    ()=>{
        return {
            someProperty: 'some value'
        }
    }
];

foo[2]().someProperty; //some value
```

You can create an array that has a function that returns an object that has an array

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    'apple',
    ()=>{
        return {
            someArray: ['cat', 'dog', 'baboon']
        }
    }
];

foo[2]().someArray[2]; //baboon
```

You can create an array that has a function that returns an object that has an object

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    'apple',
    ()=>{
        return {
            someObject: {
                someProperty: 'some value'
            }
        }
    }
];

foo[2]().someObject.someProperty; //some value
```

You can create an array that has a function that returns an object that has a method

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    'apple',
    ()=>{
        return {
            someMethod:()=>{
                console.log('fun');
            }
        }
    }
];

foo[2]().someMethod(); //logs fun
```

You can create an array that has a function that returns a function

```javascript
const foo = [
    1,
    'apple',
    ()=>{
        return ()=>{
            console.log('yes!');
        }
    }
];

foo[2]()(); //logs yes!
```
