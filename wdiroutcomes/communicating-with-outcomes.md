## Communication
* I love getting to know you, and it makes my job easier, so be sure to be in touch with me regularly.
* Bring questions you have to your outcomes sessions; almost always you will have some time at the end to talk with me.
* If you slack or email me, please give me 24 hours to respond. I work with about 75 students at a time and want to be sure to give your question the attention it deserves.
