# Meeting One-on-One with Your Outcomes Coach

I love meeting and talking with you, please don't be shy! 

One-on-Ones are a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Your previous work history 
- Goals for your future 
- Creating your job search strategy 
- Getting you past roadblocks 
- Follow up or networking strategies 
- Feedback on your materials 
- Emotional issues

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared and be on time! I also ask that you let me know if you have to cancel your time slot, either via email or Slack. 

Also, please do not sign up for times during your class/lab time as you will not be excused to leave class to meet with me. Find times during your lunch hour or after class. If there are not slots available and you would really like to meet, please message me directly and we'll work something out.
