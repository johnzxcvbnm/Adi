# WDI + DSI: Portfolio Reviews      

## Learning Objectives: 

* Get feedback on your portfolio from peers and GA staff. Remember your final MUST be complete by Outcomes Bootcamp 

* Practice introducing yourself in the same format as the Student Spotlight

## Framing: 

The Portfolio Review is an opportunity for you to get firsthand experience sharing your work and showing off everything you have worked so hard for with GA! We do not expect you to have a perfect portfolio at this time; however, remember that you will get the best feedback the farther along you are. Be prepared to discuss your work, your plans for completing any unfinished pieces, and most importantly your process.

## Format: 

The format will be speed dating style where you’ll have the chance to get one-on-one feedback. 

We’ll break the class in half and half of the class will be reviewers for 1 hour, and the other half will be presenters. After an hour we will switch roles.
