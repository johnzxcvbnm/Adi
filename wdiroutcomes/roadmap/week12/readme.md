# Week 12 DSI: Qualification Check-in     

## Learning Objectives:

* Go over outcomes events post graduation

* Get feedback on your materials

## Framing:

We know you are in the final sprint for your projects. All we need is 20 minutes of your time! We’ll all come together to go over all things outcomes post-course, and then meet with each of you for 10-15 minutes to check-in on your outcomes materials.
