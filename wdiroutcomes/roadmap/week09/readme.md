# Qualification Check In + Post Course Expectations 

## Framing:

I know you are in the final sprint for your projects. All I need is 20-30 minutes of your time! We’ll all come together to go over all things outcomes post-course, and then I'll meet with each of you for 10-15 minutes to check-in on your outcomes materials.

## Learning Objectives & Themes:

This is where the rubber hits the road. Ready for the transition into the big working world?  No?  That’s ok! We are still here to support you and your job search!  Let's talk about how to keep the Job Search actions going and ways to be supported! 

**Themes:** All of them! 

## Final Material Expectations:
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, and GA Profile to be final at this point, but understand if you are still working on adding your final project and portfolio. Remember that your portfolio must be complete within one week of graduation to receive support from Outcomes. 

**Due next Monday by 7 PM:**
