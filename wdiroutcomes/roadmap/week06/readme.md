# Defining Your Job Search Requirements

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand what actually makes you happy in your career

* Communicate what you are looking for in your career to future employers

* Have a way to decide if an organization is a good fit for you

* Get feedback on your Resume and begin to build your job search strategy with your career coach


## Framing:

What is a must-have in your next career? How do you narrow down your job search strategy? What is the must-have versus nice-to-have? Being able to communicate WHY you want a job is just as important as why you are a good fit for a job. We will tackle these questions and more this week. Be ready with your Organizational Research for a deep dive. 

## You do:

- Pull out a piece of paper or new document on your computer

- Think about the last 5 roles you have had. If you recently graduated think of volunteer roles you’ve had, roles in clubs, sports teams, or membership organizations.

- On the left hand side of the page right out all of the things you liked about each of those roles

- On the right hand side of the page list out all of the things that you didn’t like about the roles

**Think about: **

- Team structure - did you work alone or part of a team? Or both?

- Structure of the work environment - was it flexible? Bureaucratic? Creative? Lively? Quiet?

- Culture - was it fun? Serious? Creative? Supportive? Smart? Mission driven?

- Management style

- Commute

- Dress code

- Physical environment

- Salary

- Professional development and growth

- . . . and anything else!

Now, take a step back and look for any over-arching themes - what do you see?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Next, write down your core values professionally and personally. Don’t think too much about this, just what first comes into your head, and this will be a list that continues to grow. Some ideas:

* Integrity

* Authenticity

* Growth

* Kindness

* Peace

* Courage

* Adventure

* Generosity

* Making the world a better place

* Joy/play

* Creativity

What connections do you see between your values and your likes/dislikes?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Now look at your list of likes/dislikes and choose your 3 non-negotiables. The 3 things that you know if they aren’t there you won’t be able to be successful or happy.
