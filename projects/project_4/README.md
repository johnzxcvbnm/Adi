# Project #4: Ruby on Rails - Group Project

## Overview

For your 4th project, you will be collaborating to make an application using Ruby on Rails as the backend with a React front end.

Use your imagination to find an app idea that you feel excited to build! Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**, but you'll have partners to help you carry the load.

## Attendance

As always, there will be no attendance during project weeks. But as per usual please make sure you're working on your project every day, and don't forget to communicate with your partners!

And don't forget Outcomes!!!!

- **Thursdsay, August 16**: Project presentation day! You're required to be in the class zoom starting at 10:00 AM ET

## Standups

Not required, but a suggestion: consider having stand-ups with your partner every day to keep track of how your project progress is coming along. Consider the following points to talk about:

  - What did I work on yesterday
  - What am I trying to get done today
  - What is preventing me from getting this done.
  - Read more about daily scrum/stand-ups [here](/unit_3/w08d01/morning_exercise)!

## Meetings with instructors

**Friday August 10**

Your group will meet with your dedicated project instructor for 15 minutes to get your app idea approved. Be sure to write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas.

_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time for project approval_

**Before you meet with your instructor**: 

   - Meet to discuss your ideas with your teammate(s) and choose one idea (remember, you can always use other ideas for your next project(s))
   - Create the project's Github repo *OUTSIDE* of the class repository.
   - Create your user stories and add them to your `README.md`
   - Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
   - Make wireframes and add them to your `README.md` (or put images and add links)
   - Create your daily tracker

## File Setup
- One person should create the Github repo (outside of the class repo, and on regular github, not github enterprise). When this person creates the new rails project this time, **don't** `--skip-git`, we actually want it to initialize git! 
- Everyone else should clone the repo from Github onto their own machine *outside* of the class repo.
- Everyone that cloned the repo should go inside their new local repo and create a `.gitignore` file. [Here is a list of useful .gitignores](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **working full-stack Rails application, built by you & your group members** that uses **Postgres as the database** and **React as the front end**. 
* At least one model with full CRUD on it
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often!
* At **least** one Github commit per day per member
* A **daily tracker** that all group members use (Trello, github issues, or another similar tracker)
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via Heroku
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc. As well as a **link to your hosted working app**
* **Info filled out in the google sheet** - you can add it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1nwHLf7zIangGmKpxXCu1t7BQHNlXDEy3owYEBmrvLYc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112602722655819861257).

ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5-10 minutes in length
  * All group members should speak during the presentation
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make

Additionally, we would like each group member to answer at least at least one of the following questions:

1) What went well for your group?
2) What was your groups biggest struggle?
3) What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most
4) What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didn’t anticipate

### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features - choose any

* Use Sass
* Include **two or more models**
* Include either a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship
* Use a **third party API** with a gem
* What about using **graphs or visuals** on your data? Chart.js , D3.js
* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo)
* **Authentication**
* **Implement React Router** 
* **Implement Redux or Flux** 
* **Use the gem Webpacker** that will compile your React components
* **Use the create-reactapp** to build your front end (note you will have to have two git repos and then two heroku apps. You'll make url requests from your react app to your rails app. Your rails app will need to have CORS configured correctly to accept these requests.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* Create your **user stories**

<br>

* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class TA
  - There will not be double TA hours during project week since you'll have each other. However, TA hours will still be available once a day from 1-4 PM ET on the weekdays
