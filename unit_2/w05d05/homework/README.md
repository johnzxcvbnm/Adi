Tonight's homework is in three-parts, first start with [Mongo Burgers](/unit_2/w05d05/homework/mongo_burgers/README.md) in the `mongo_burgers` folder<br>

Then once you finish Mongo Burgers, move on to [Mongoose Hotels](/unit_2/w05d05/homework/hotels_app/README.md) in the `hotels_app` folder
<br>

Then, as always, you have a weekend mockup:
