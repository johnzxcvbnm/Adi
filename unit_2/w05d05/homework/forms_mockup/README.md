# Styling Forms

---

Title: Styling Forms<br>
Type: Homework<br>
Creator: Jerrica Bobadilla, Karolin Rafalski<br>
Competencies: Styling input forms <br>
Prerequisites: HTML, CSS

---

## Objective

Input forms are one of the main ways users interact with apps and how we collect data from users. Because they're prevalent in basic CRUD apps, let's get some practice in styling them! Below we provide you with several screenshots of styled input forms. Your job is to use these screenshots as mockups and recreate the styles yourself.


## Set up

1. Inside this `forms_mockup` folder, touch an `index.html` and a `styles.css`
1. Make sure to connect your css to your html file and check in your browser to make sure you did so correctly


## Activity

**Pick three** out of the form mockups provided below and recreate them! Make sure to provide a comment in your HTML file or a header above each form stating which mockups you recreate.

  - We have notes on them [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Web-Development-Immersive-Remote/WDIR-Adi/wiki/FORMS) and [here](/unit_2/w05d05/morning_exercise/README.md)
  - [We have a 'cheatsheet' provided in the student wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Web-Development-Immersive-Remote/WDIR-Adi/wiki/HTML-Forms-Cheatsheet)

Note: if you grab a chunk of CSS from somewhere online be sure to include an acknowledgement of where you got in somewhere in your file!

Don't worry about matching the fonts of the mockups exactly, but consider poking around [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to see what kind of fonts you can use to give your styling a little more polish
